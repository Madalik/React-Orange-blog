CRUD-React-app 

This project is a personal blog about traveling, containing articles and information about everything that planning a vacation involves (transportation, accommodation, sights, food recommendations).
The website is created “responsive” = it can be viewed from PC, tablet of mobile phone.
It was designed that, in the future, it can be adapted, extended to other ideas in this area of the business.

The main page

The header (the upper part, containing the menu, has the Hover function for each of the 4 pages of the project) and Footer (the bottom part of the page) – these can be found throuout the entire project.
A list with all the travel articles about the places visited and reviews about them. Each article is highlighted (hover) when the user has the mouse over it.
